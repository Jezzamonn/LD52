## About

I took this Ludum Dare a little more relaxed than previous ones, which was nice! This was originally going to be a compo game, but at the deadline and decided I wanted to polish it a little more, so I entered the jam instead. On the third day, my wife jumped in and helped create the background art.

I enjoyed making it, and I'll definitely be releasing a post-compo one with more levels, so stay tuned for that. Let me know if you have any ideas you'd like to see in the game :)
